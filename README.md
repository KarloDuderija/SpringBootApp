# Getting Started

### Maven dependencies
- Spring Boot Security 
- Passay
- MySQL
- Hibernate validator
- Bootstrap
- Thymeleaf

### Simple login and registration app
2FA with Vonage, Captcha or other.
Basic example with Spring Boot Security.

###MYSQL
- username: root
- password: password

As you can also see in the application properties, it is set to update, which means no script is needed to run prior to setup the base.

###Thymeleaf
Thymeleaf templates are used for view.

###SpringSecurity
Even tho it has it's own 2FA logic, it is ignored here with custom 2FA implementation.

###TO START
Just setup the local MySQL, be sure to change credentials and start the application.
